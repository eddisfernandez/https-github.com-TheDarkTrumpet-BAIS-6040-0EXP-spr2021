    "When turning in your homework, there are some criteria you should be aware of that will impact your grade. Remember first, we're working with a 70% correctness, and 30% format/naming criteria here. The first few homeworks will be lightly impacted by the format/naming, but it'll become far more important starting around homework 3 and 4. Some things you want to watch for, for each criteria, and how to solve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness:\n",
    "What to look for\tTips to Solve\n",
    "Does the entire notebook run, start to finish\tBefore turning in your notebook, be sure to click \"restart kernel\" and run all cells. Look to the left of the code cells and make sure that you see numbers, and no exceptions\n",
    "Does it produce the expected output\tYou can work with the values that I provide, and aim to get the same output as a validation step. Often times it's best to look over your logic.\n",
    "Are you using the right algorithm(s)?\tYou don't have to worry much about this right now, but in module 2 and further on, we'll start getting into loops and multiple ways of coding a particular solution. Is the algorithm you choose the better one?\n",
    "Am I using the right libraries/functionality?\tIn general, try to use what's provided up to that point in class. In other words, if you decide to use a library that either isn't covered, or hasn't been covered up to this point, and the reason can't be justified, it'll impact your grade.\n",
    "Format:\n",
    "What to look for\tTips to Solve\n",
    "Do the variable names make sense and describe the data it holds\tNames should be descriptive, like we did in part 5. Aim for something similar\n",
    "Is the naming convention consistent?\tThere are many options for names, but it's important to be consistent. For example, PizzaPrice, pizzaPrice, and pizza_price are all ways of describing the name contents, but have different formats. Pick a style, and stick to it\n",
    "Is there documentation where it needs to be?\tI recommend that you have your notebook setup in a certain way with an introduction at top, helper functions next, implementation last. With other chunks to denote very different areas of one's notebook (e.g. loading data from plots, etc.)\n",
    "In our notebook here, we left an error in part 4. There are two parts to all this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, restart the kernel, and click \"run all\". Scroll through the results. Notice what cells are returning values and which ones aren't. Pay special attention to part 4. You should see the exception, but look at part 5. Did any of that get printed out?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, lets assume this is a block of code that you had problems with and wanted feedback on. Go back to part 4, where we did the division by 0 and change the cell from \"Code\" to \"Raw\" (You can do this by clicking on the cell, and looking at the dropdown at the top of the window). Now, put a comment of some kind above the code. I recommend in the same block that can say something like \"I don't understand what this exception means\". When asking for help in a notebook, this is what you do. Make the cell raw, add a comment, and go on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of how this should look, when done, is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "# I don't understand what DivideByZero means 5/0\n",
    "After you alter the cell, and add the comment, restart the kernel again and rerun the entire notebook. Now, you should see every code cell with results right after.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tip for successfully completing homeworks (and tests). I provide the homework as in Github. If you are overwriting your checkout of the notebook, then I recommend you open the notebook in a web browser on github directly. This was described in the homework description video, but the direct link for this notebook is: Homework 1\n",
